This code goes through all of the main in one go (there is no menu option or loop continuing the code).
It goes through all of the assignment requirements: reading an array, looking for a number in an array,
modifying a number ata a specific index, adding a number the end of the array, and removing an integer from
a specific index of the array. Most of the code is run using for loops to read and find indexes of the array.
With the for-loops I was also able to look for a number or index, as well as to change the information at a specific
index if necessary with the function.
